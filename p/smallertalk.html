			This is a yet-to-be-implemented demake of the programming language Smalltalk,
			which is heavily based on the object-oriented paradigm.
			In fact, it's so object-oriented, it almost feels a bit... functional.
			Of course, state is basically 1/3rd of the language:
			<blockquote>
				A Smalltalk object can do exactly three things:
				<ol>
					<li>Hold state (references to other objects).</li>
					<li>Receive a message from itself or another object.</li>
					<li>In the course of processing a message,
						send messages to itself or another object.</li>
				</ol>
			</blockquote>
		Although, the other 2/3 seems to be functional, even though that's an imperative thing.
		ok, i'll stop talking about that.
		</p>
		<p>
			First, let's talk about the main thing: objects.
			I'm gonna take an approach similar to Squeak
			(the most mainstream Smalltalk dialect!),
			and make a class a directory.
			The directory will contain other inherited classes as directories,
			and methods as files. The names of these will be the names of the classes and methods.
			Here's an example, where <kbd>-</kbd> is a level,
			and <kbd>$</kbd> is a file instead of a directory:
<pre>
Object
- Magnitude
-- Number
--$ +:x
--$ -:x
--- Float
---$ round;
--- Integer
---$ isDivisibleBy\::x
---$ toBase\::x
</pre>
		As you can see, the : suffix allows input, while the ; suffix doesn't. Both are invisible.
		So, it's <samp>3 toBase: 2</samp>, but it's <samp>3 + 4</samp>.
		I guess this also means composition is just symbolic links...
		<note>You can escape colons and semicolons,
			but you have to do <samp>\:</samp>,
			which for you is <samp>\\:</samp>,
			which would, with :, be <samp>\\::</samp>.</note>
		You can prefix file names with <kbd>^</kbd> to make them private
		to the object from it's subclass object(s). Calling a class by itself
		(e.g. to set a variable to) uses the init or init: method.
		Ambiguity in the form of having two methods start the same,
		but have different amounts of parameters throws an error.
		Also, classes are now objects that simply hold objects.
		If an object doesn't have a method, it passes it to its class,
		which can also pass it to its class, ad infinitum.
		</p>
		<p>
			Arbritrary amounts of input should be manhandled (manually handled).
			But you know what else should be manhandled? returning.
			Instead of self and thisContext, we have <samp>this</samp>.
			We can call <samp>this :: 1</samp> to <strong>become</strong>,
			and <samp>this := x 1</samp> to <em>hold</em>,
			reminiscent of functio&mdash;Oh, wow, haha.
			Becoming doesn't change the object's class, just that object.
			The Object class will have a <samp>hasHeld:</samp> for variables,
			that returns false by default, and has to be changed by inheritors.
			(Don't worry, true, false, and nil aren't psuedovariables,
			they're just normal variables made in the Object class.)
			Also, super can be avoided by An OrderedCollection,
			and <samp>this</samp> actually refers to the local space.
			So, <pre>[:a :b | this :: a + b;]</pre> works like a Polish notation +.
			Actually, you know what? I'll make blocks take exactly one argument,
			and becuase of that you don't need the : prefix or the |.
			So, it's now <pre>[a [b this :: a + b;]]</pre>
		</p>
		<p>
			Let me just list some more things.
			Strings are just arrays of characters, so you don't need them.
			Symbols are just faster strings, so no to those either.
			
			<kbd>;</kbd> replaces <kbd>.</kbd> as the command separator.
			(I do like ., but ; is just the standard!)
			<kbd>&&</kbd> replaces <kbd>;</kbd> as the method separator.
		</p>
		<p>
			This code snippet by Ralph Johnson:
<pre>
exampleWithNumber: x
	| y |
	true & false not & (nil isNil) ifFalse: [self halt].
	y := self size + super size.
	#($a #a 'a' 1 1.0)
		do: [ :each |
			Transcript show: (each class name);
						 show: ' '].
	^x &lt; y
</pre>
			becomes:
<pre>
(true & false) not & (nil isNil) ifFalse: [this :: 0];
this := y (this size + super size);
OrderedCollection add: $a add: (OrderedCollection) add: $a add: 1 add: 1.0
do: [each
	Transcript show: (each name) &&
	show: $ ];
this :: (x &lt; y);
</pre>
