				This is a list of programming languages I know, in order of knowledge-ish.
				(id est, They are sorted only in their categories, and the order is vague.)
			</p>
			<h1>Well known</h1>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>Scratch</h2>
				<a href="https://scratch.mit.edu"></a>
				<p>
					This is the first programming "software" I've ever used.
					As a result, I'm very fond of it. I still talk with my friends
					from Scratch.
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>Python</h2>
				<a href="https://python.org">src</a>
				please do not start with
				<a href="https://youtu.be/K5KVEU3aaeQ?si=m-hem849mBM7_uIL">this</a>
				tutorial!
				<p>
					This is the first real language I use. I've made a bunch of things with
					it before. But, it does make sense why most people don't <u>use</u> use
					Python: It is great for scripting, but other languages are much better
					suited with it. It's probably one of few languages, with Scratch
					for example, to work first try most of the time; it just clicks.
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>C</h2>
				<a href="https://www.c-language.org/">src</a>
				<a href="https://ineasysteps.com/products-page/
				c-programming-easy-steps-5th-edition-2/">me</a>
				<p>
					I really like coding in this language, and I can see it's use, but
					there's so much unsafety revolving around it.
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<h1>Have learnt or are learning</h1>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>Haskell</h2>
				<a href="https://haskell.org">src</a>
				<a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Haskell">me</a>
				<p>
					This is a declarative programming language, and because of that,
					as well as being strongly typed, it's one of those few to click.
					It gets more confusing as you do metaprogramming and whatnot.
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>x86</h2>
				<a href="https://download-mirror.savannah.gnu.org/
				releases/pgubook/ProgrammingGroundUp-1-0-booksize.pdf">me</a>
				<p>
					Very fun using it. It's like Scratch, but much harder! However,
					using AT&T syntax is not very fun, which is what this book teaches.
					I mean, is it easier to use,
					<div><samp>[rax + 4 * 8]</samp></div> or <div><samp>(%rax,$4,$8)</samp>?</div>
					Maybe I can check <a href="https://brettapitz.github.io/posts/groundup1/">
					this one?</a>
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>JS</h2>
				<a href="https://ecma-international.org/
				publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-262/">src</a>
				<p>
					I learnt this one from Khan Academy. I use it seldom.
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>Snap!</h2>
				<p>
					This is basically Scratch with extra steps. But it's definitely
					worth checking out!
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<h1>Would learn</h1>
			<p>
				To be honest, most of the programming languages in this
				and the next category are there because they are cool.
			</p>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>Crystal</h2>
				<p>
					Either this or Ruby is likely something I will learn soon.
					It's similar to Ruby, but with some other stuff added.
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>Ruby</h2>
				<p>
					It is an object oriented language, and it is like a cleaner
					Smalltalk.
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>Elixir</h2>
				<p>
					It is part of the Erlang family, and it might be the most
					popular out of them.
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>Lean 4</h2>
				<p>
					It is a programming language made for proofs. I might not
					really use it for anything serious, but it's still kinda fun
					to prove things in it.
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>Ante</h2>
				<p>
					It is, simply put, a low-level functional programming language.
					You don't always see those words together unless something
					weird happens, but this isn't weird.
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>C++</h2>
				<p>
					C++ is much more popular than C, but I have heard it's much
					more complicated. I will eventually have to learn this or C#,
					and this seems like the better choice.
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>Lua</h2>
				<p>
					I've learnt the basics of it, but I haven't used it in anything.
					It is a very small but powerful language, and it pops up in
					programs that allow modifications in the form of code. Roblox
					is the biggest example.
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>Scala</h2>
			</hgroup>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>TS</h2>
				<p>
					A <del>better</del><ins>superior</ins> form of Javascript made
					by Microsoft. I should probably learn it for generic but various
					reasons.
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>Seed7</h2>
				<a href="https://seed7.net/">src</a>
				<p>
					It is a C-like simple programming language that
					and allows you to modify the language itself. Doesn't
					that sound awesome?
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>Vyxal</h2>
				<p>
					It is a very popular and very effective golfing programming language,
					meaning you can write VERY short programs in it.
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>Go</h2>
				<p>
					It is a safe programming language that is sort of
					overrated, but not entirely.
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>(Common) Lisp</h2>
				<p>
					It is an extremely simple yet somehow powerful
					language that is composed of list expressions.
					It is a lot like assembly, except it is of course
					on a much higher abstraction.
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>Racket, Clojure...</h2>
				<p>
					These are simply dialects of Lisp, which there are a lot of.
				</p>
			</hgroup>
			<h1>Interesting</h1>
			<hgroup>
				<h2>C#</h2>
				<h2>Red</h2>
				<h2>Erlang</h2>
				<h2>Smalltalk</h2>
				<h2>Elm</h2>
				<h2>Java</h2>
				<h2>Golfscript</h2>
				<h2>Gleam</h2>
				<h2>Rust</h2>
				<h2>Zig</h2>
				<h2>Pascal</h2>
				<h2>Fortran</h2>
				<h2>Forth</h2>
			</hgroup>
